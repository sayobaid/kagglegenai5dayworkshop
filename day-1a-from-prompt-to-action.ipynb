    "\n",
    "- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Make Your Own Copy**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run any code in this notebook, you first need your own editable copy.\n",

    "🚨 **NOTE:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 **NOTE:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)"
